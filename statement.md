# Project Title : 
Stored Stock Data Viewer using Tkinter & SQLite 

# Problem Statement:
Managing and accessing historical stock data efficiently is a challenge for small-scale analysts and individuals.Manual tracking lacks an interactive and organized approach, making it time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to solve these issues by providing a user-friendly interface to view stored stock prices directly from a local database. 

# Objective:

  To develop a GUI-based application that supports quick viewing and retrieval of stock data. 

  To minimize manual tracking by automating data display through database queries. 

  To demonstrate integration between Python’s graphical capabilities (Tkinter) and SQL operations (SQLite). 
  
# Scope:

  Display list of available stocks for selection. 

  On-demand retrieval of stock price and timestamp data. 
  
  Modular code for future enhancements (e.g., analytics, data entry). 
  
  User accessibility for non-technical users. 
  
# Target Users:

  Individual investors managing personal stock records. 
  
  Students learning database and GUI programming concepts. 
  
  Educators conducting practical sessions on Python application development. 

  Small business analysts tracking limited stock datasets.
  
# High Level Features:

   Intuitive dropdown to select stocks from database records. 
   Tabular display of price and timestamp data for the chosen stock. 
   Real-time data retrieval with instant refresh. 
   Local data persistence via SQLite for easy setup and cross-platform use. 
   Clear interface with modular functions, enabling future feature additions. 
   
# Technologies Used:

   Python 3 

  Tkinter (GUI library) 
   
  SQLite (sqlite3 module)
